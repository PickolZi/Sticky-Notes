# Sticky Notes Web App

[Live demo](https://sticky-notes-pickolzi.vercel.app/)

## Purpose
The purpose of this web application is to be able to write down and keep track of your thoughts and ideas through sticky notes from anywhere! Ranging from your computer to your phone, it can be accessed anywhere as long as you have an internet connection.

## Why did I make this Web Application?
I am currently on a self-growth journey and have been writing down lots of my thoughts and ideas on physical sticky notes, however, recently it has gotten out of hand and now my desk is covered with sticky notes from who knows where and when. 

If you look at the past few days my github history has been pretty empty, and that's mostly because I have been following tutorials on React. So now is the time for me to put those tutorials to the test and practice what I know by creating a web application with **React**.

## How to run the web app
TBD
